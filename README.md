## Introduction 

This guide provides a simple and yet comprehensive guide to creating and then integrating SpaDES 
compatible modules. It is divided in two parts. PART I focuses on the 
creation of a new SpaDES module from scratch, while PART II focuses on developing a new project and 
integrating the module created in PART I with two other SpaDES compatible modules hosted online. The .Rmd file 
was not planned to be knitted for running. Instead, please follow the explanation from the [html file](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/EFI_webinar/blob/main/HandsOn.html).

The [presentation]() and [this tutorial](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/EFI_webinar/blob/main/HandsOn.html) will be presented on April 15th 2024 at the EFI/ESA [Statistical Ecology Section webinar series](https://ecoforecast.org/workshops/statistical-methods-seminar-series/#details), 
and live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjE6j9Mw_K8). To register for the seminar, please [click here](https://notredame.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_7HIO_OJERCWpVbLEK_q5QA)
