## Introduction 

This guide provides a simple and yet comprehensive guide to creating and then integrating SpaDES 
compatible modules (hereby "SpaDES modules"). It is divided in two parts. PART I focuses on the 
creation of a new SpaDES module from scratch, while PART II focuses on developing a new project and 
integrating the module created in PART I with two other SpaDES compatible modules hosted online. The .Rmd file 
was not planned to be knitted for running. Instead, please follow the explanation from the [html file](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/EFI_webinar/blob/main/HandsOn.html).

## Happy SpaDESing!
