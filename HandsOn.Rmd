## Introduction 

This guide provides a simple and yet comprehensive guide to creating and then integrating SpaDES 
compatible modules (hereby "SpaDES modules"). It is divided in two parts. PART I focuses on the 
creation of a new SpaDES module from scratch, while PART II focuses on developing a new project and 
integrating the module created in PART I with two other SpaDES compatible modules hosted online.  

## PART I: creating a SpaDES compatible module from scratch  

### 1. Planning the New Module  

The first thing we will do is step away from `R` and list all needed `inputs`, desired `outputs` and 
`parameters` (arguments a user can control) the module will need to run. This will depend on the 
objective you have in mind. In our example, we want to:   
1. Download abundance data (with locations and year of counts);   
2. For each year, we want to convert the table into a raster file;   
3. We want to check the distribution of the values and rasters for each year;  
4. In the end, we ant to build a simple linear model to check if and how the abundance is changing though time.  

For that, we will need as an `input` the dataset with counts, locations (in lat/long format) and year 
of survey (`abund`). We also want to `output` two objects, a raster stack of abundance through time, with one raster 
of abundance values per year (`abundaRas`), and the simple linear model we created to check the change in abundance 
through time (`modAbund`). Moreover, we want to be able to define two `parameters`, which in this simple example, 
are mostly related to plotting: the name of the study area (`.studyAreaName`), and the first year for 
plotting (`.plotInitialTime`).    

Once we have out list of `inputs`, `outputs` and `parameters`, we should hash out how our module will 
work. This means, drawing a conceptual model of (1) which `events` will happen in our analysis or simulation, 
(2) in which order will they happen, (3) how are `inputs`, `outputs` and `parameters` related to these 
events, and among themselves. This is extremely helpful in the early days of using SpaDES, while you 
familiarize yourself with the template. Figure 1 details what is envisioned for this module:

\newpage

Once this has been done, it is time to start working on the new module.  

### 2. Installing and Loading Libraries  

We will start by installing `Require`, which is a package which tries to resolve all possible 
package dependencies and versioning to ensure reproducibility. This package is used in the background
 by SpaDES modules, but can also be used as a general approach to installing and loading libraries 
 from both CRAN and github. We first test if `Require` has already been installed, and if not, we 
 install and load it.

```{r Require}
if(!require("Require")){
  install.packages("Require")
}
library("Require")
```

After loading `Require`, we install and/or load SpaDES.  

```{r SpaDES}
Require("SpaDES")
```

### 3. Creating a New Module  

Once SpaDES has been loaded, we use the function `newModule()` to create a new module. The function 
takes two arguments: `name`, the name of the module, and `path`, which is the directory where you  
want to create this new module. The new module is a simply a folder containing the following files:  

- **Templated Module’s Manual**: where the module's usage is detailed - `module.Rmd`.  
- **Functions’ folder**: where functions may be saved (alternatively, they can also be stored in the module's R file) - `R/`.  
- **Tests folder**: where the unit tests are hosted - `tests/`.  
- **Data folder**: where potential data for the module may be saved (alternatively, data can also be saved in a common inputs folder on the project level, if it may be shared across models) - `data/`.   
- **README**: where basic information about the module can be added - `README.md`.    
- **NEWS**: where improvements from previous module versions can be communicated - `NEWS.md`.    
- **Citation**: where you define how your module should be cited - `citation.bib`.    
- **LICENSE**: where you establish which type of license your module will have - `LICENSE.md`.    
- **Module**: Templated script constituted of 3 Main Parts (plus potential functions) - `module.Rmd`.    

```{r newModule}
newModule(name = "speciesAbundance", path = "~/EFI")
```

When we create the module, we get the following message and the module file (`speciesAbundance.R`), 
is opened in the source window. The message repeats what we discussed above.  

```{r newModuleInfo}
New module speciesAbundance created at C:/Users/Tati/Documents/EFI
* edit module code in speciesAbundance.R
* write tests for your module code in tests/
* describe and document your module in speciesAbundance.Rmd
* tell others how to cite your module by editing citation.bib
* choose a license for your module; see LICENSE.md
Using RStudio; may need to open manually e.g., with file.edit or file.show
file.edit('C:/Users/Tati/Documents/EFI/speciesAbundance/speciesAbundance.R')
Using RStudio; may need to open manually e.g., with file.edit or file.show
file.edit('C:/Users/Tati/Documents/EFI/speciesAbundance/speciesAbundance.Rmd')
```

### 4. Editing the New Module  

Now we can start working on the new module's file. We will skip the module documentation (manual, 
citation, readme and license) and tests due to time constraints, but you should never skip these 
when developing your modules, so they can be used by others.  

#### 4.1. Descriptive Metadata\
\
We will start by filling out the descriptive metadata for our module. This part of the module is 
composed of the following parts:  

- **name**: Module's name, which was prefilled when the module was created.  
- **description**: Module's description, where details about the module can be found, such as why the 
module was created and its basic working mechanism. Almost as an abstract of the modules' usefulness. 
If you want to avoid long lines, you can wrap the description with the function `paste0()`, as seen below.
- **keywords**: Keywords for helping the module getting properly indexed. If more than one keyword is 
added, it is important to remember to concatenate all words using a `c("keyword 1", "keyword 2", "keyword 3")`.  
- **authors**: Add information on author(s), including contact. This is the best way to ensure someone 
can contact you if they want to discuss any specific infoirmation about your module.  
- **childModules**: This is used when the current module represents a parent (i.e., grouping) module. 
It's a mechanism to simplify getting a group of modules which are expected to work together. We won't 
be using it in this simple example. Although in the descriptive metadata part, this is also functional.  
- **version**: We follow a software development versioning system for the modules, combining the Numeric
status and the Numeric 90+ scheme. This system has 4 codes, separated by `.`. The first number indicates 
the major structureal changes to the module, the second indicates minor changes, but generally in more 
than one place, the third indicates bug fixes, and the last indicates punctual enhancements or bugfixes. 
With such system, we hope modules will be continuously updated and the exact version used for 
publications can be backtraced.  
- **timeframe**: Indicates the original or exemplified time frame of the module (i.e., from 2013 to 2022).  
- **timeunit**: This is an important information and also functional when modules have divergent time 
units. SpaDES converts all times internally to seconds in order to allow the integration of modules 
happening at different time scales.  
- **citation**: Indicates the file where the citation for the module can be found. The citation 
template format is [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org/).  
- **documentation**: Indicates all files that are related to the module in terms of documentation. If, 
for example, the user decides to create a vignette for the module apart from the manual, it can be 
added here.  

Once the descriptive metadata has been updated for our example module `speciesAbundance`, it should 
look similar to this:  

```{r descriptiveMetadata}
  name = "speciesAbundance",
  description = paste0("This is a simple example module on how SpaDES work. It uses made",
                       " up data and is partially based on the example publised by ",
                       "Barros et al., 2022 (DOI: 10.1111/2041-210X.14034)"),
  keywords = c("example", "SpaDES tutorial"),
  authors = structure(list(list(given = "Tati", family = "Micheletti", 
                                role = c("aut", "cre"), 
                                email = "tati.micheletti@gmail.com", 
                                comment = NULL)), 
                      class = "person"),
  childModules = character(0),
  version = list(speciesAbundance = "0.0.0.9000"),
  timeframe = as.POSIXlt(c(2013, 2022)),
  timeunit = "year",
  citation = list("citation.bib"),
  documentation = list("NEWS.md", "README.md", "speciesAbundance.Rmd"),
```

#### 4.2. Functional Metadata\
\
An important part of a SpaDES module is the functional metadata. This is a hybrid approach between 
human-readable information and code used by SpaDES to schedule the events happening across modules. 
This part of the module is composed of the following parts:
- **reqdPkgs**: names of the packages (potentially with version) needed for the module to run. If the 
packages are not specified, SpaDES will not load them for the module to use and any functions dependent 
on the omitted packages will fail.   
*Example:* in our example, we will need the following packages: 
`data.table` (for organizing and working on our dataset), `terra` (for converting our dataset to a 
spatially explicit dataset) and `ggplot2` (which is default in the template, so there is no need to 
add it again, similarly to `SpaDES.core`, the package that orchestrates the whole system).  

- **parameters**: this is one of the crucial parts of the functional metadata, together with 
`inputObjects` and `outputObjects`. It defines the parameters a user can pass to the module (e.g., 
arguments to a function), a default value when the user doesn't provide one, the expected range a 
parameter can take if e.g. numeric and the description of the parameter. This is defined by the function 
`defineParameter()` and the template provides several potential parameters of interest for the module 
developer. These predefined parameters are generally preceded by `.`, but are not required to be used 
nor removed from the module if not used. Module developers are also expected to add their own parameters 
of interest which do not have to be preceded by `.`.   
*Example: *in our example case, we will use as parameters two of the pre-defined examples provided 
by the template: `.plotInitialTime` and `.studyAreaName`. These will mainly be used for the plotting 
event in this simple case.  

- **inputObjects**: input objects are the objects expected to be present for the module to run. These 
are similar, for example to a dataset or a spatial object that will be passed as a function argument. 
These are generally provided by the user, but should have a default in case the user does not provide 
it, so that the module can run independently of providing data, similarly to a test-run. The importance 
of providing such default (which will be discussed below) cannot be overstated: this is crucial for 
users of your module to be able to see the module functioning and understand its mechanisms. The input 
objects are defined by the function `expectsInput()` with all arguments in quotes: object name 
(`objectName`), the class of the expected input (`objectClass`), a description of the expected object 
(`desc`) and, if available online, the source address in the form of a URL (`sourceURL`). The last can 
be used by SpaDES to retrieve the object using the function `prepInputs()` from the package 
`reproducible` (which is a part of the SpaDES metapackage)`.   
*Example:* in our example, the module expects only a data frame with the following columns: `counts` 
(abundance in a numeric form), `years` (year of the data collection in numeric form) and coordinates 
in  latlong system (two columns, `lat` and `long`, indicating latitude and longitude, respectively).  

- **outputObjects**: these are the objects created by the module. Similarly to the input objects, here 
we should also provide object name, object class and description. Failing to provide the `outputObjects` 
will result in the simulation not returning these at the end.
*Example:* in our example, we will create three outputs. The first one, is named `abundaRas`, which is 
a raster object of spatially explicit abundance data for a given year, compatible with `terra` (i.e., 
`spatRaster` object). The second one, is named `allAbundRas`, which is a raster stack of all 
`abundaRas`. The third one is `modAbund`, a fitted model (of the `lm` class) of abundance through time. 
Outputting a model object could, for example, allow for posterior forecasts.  

Once the functional metadata has been updated for our example module `speciesAbundance`, it should 
look similar to this (note that the parameters not used were removed just to improve clarity):

```{r functionalMetadata}
  parameters = bindrows(
    defineParameter(".plotInitialTime", "numeric", start(sim), start(sim), end(sim),
                    paste0("Describes the simulation time at which the first plot event",
                           "should occur.")),
    defineParameter(".studyAreaName", "character", "Riparian Woodland Reserve", NA, NA,
                    paste0("Human-readable name for the study area used - e.g., a hash ",
                           "of the study area obtained using ",
                           "`reproducible::studyAreaName()`"))
  ),
  inputObjects = bindrows(
    expectsInput(objectName = "abund", 
                 objectClass = NA, 
                 desc = paste0("data frame with the following columns: `counts` ",
                               "(abundance in a numeric form), `years` (year of the data",
                               " collection in numeric form) and coordinates in  latlong",
                               " system (two columns, `lat` and `long`, indicating ",
                               "latitude and longitude, respectively)"), 
                 sourceURL = "") #<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FILL IT UP WHEN DATA HAS BEEN UPLOADED!
  ),
  outputObjects = bindrows(
    createsOutput(objectName = "abundaRas", 
                  objectClass = "spatRaster", 
                  desc = paste0("A raster object of spatially explicit abundance data ",
                                "for a given year")),
    createsOutput(objectName = "allAbundaRas", 
                  objectClass = "spatRaster", #<~~~~~~~ DOUBLE CHECK THE CLASS UPLOADED!
                  desc = "a raster stack of all `abundaRas`"),  
    createsOutput(objectName = "modAbund", objectClass = "lm", 
                  desc = paste0("A fitted model (of the `lm` class) of abundance through",
                                "time"))
  )
```

Note that for the parameter `.plotInitialTime` we add the `start()` function instead of a number 
indicating the start of the simulation. This helps maintain flexibility in the module (i.e., avoid 
hardcoding the time) in case we decide to start our simulation at a different point in time as 
presented later. The `start()`, as well as the `end()` and the `time()` functions are "shortcuts" 
SpaDES module developers can use to access the provided start, end and current time (i.e., year) of 
the simulation. They are extremely handy to use during coding of the module as we will demonstrate 
below. The argument of these functions is `sim`, which is a special class of list-type object (i.e., 
`simList`) which we will detail below. 

#### 4.3. Adding default values to `.inputObjects`\
\
As mentioned, an important step to help modules be used is to provide default objects to allow for 
a potential user to test the module. This can be done inside the module structure itself, under the 
function `.inputObjects()` (located at the end of the template). As SpaDES is modular and an object 
might be provided by the user or by another module, or may not be. It is useful, therefore, to know 
to which case the object pertains to and a function that can help with that is `suppliedElsewhere()`. 
This function can be used as a check to determine whether the module needs to proceed in getting and 
assigning its default value if the object is not being supplied by the user or by another module.  
*Example:* in the case of our example, we should add a default to our dataset `abund`. As mentioned 
before, the function `prepInputs()` can be very useful here to download and prepare the data expected 
by the module. This is a very versitile function that will return an `R` object that will have resulted
from the running of `preProcess()` (function that identifies the source of the data, and download it),
and `postProcess()` or `postProcessTo()` (which are functions that deal with loading the data with 
the specified or needed function for the data type). For example, if the data to be downloaded is a 
GIS object, it may have been cropped, reprojected, "fixed", and masked to a provided study area before it is 
assigned to an object. If it is a table, as in our case, it will be loaded with the specified function, 
in this case, `data.frame()`. We also add a warning so the user can know that the data was not supplied 
and is being retrieved by the provided url in the metadata. This is what the loading of this dataset 
will look like when added as a default inside `.inputObjects()`:  

```{r inputObjects}
if (!suppliedElsewhere(object = "abund", sim = sim)) {
  sim$abund <- prepInputs(url = extractURL("abund"),
                                  targetFile = "abundanceData.csv",
                                  destinationPath = dPath,
                                  fun = "data.frame",
                                  header = TRUE)
  warning(paste0("abund was not supplied. Using example data"), immediate. = TRUE)
}
```

The function `prepInputs()` generally expects a url address where it can find the object of interest. 
As we provided the url where the abundance dataset can be found in the metadata (i.e., the argument 
`sourceURL` in `expectsInput()`), we can here use the function `extractURL()` to get the url where 
the object is stored from the metadata. This avoids copy and paste in several places, as well as 
typos in the url, by keeping the metadata the canonical source for this information. Another interesting 
feature of `prepInputs()` is that it allows files to be hosted in Google Drive, provided the user has 
the package `googledrive` installed. The function can also usually extract the file name and function to 
load the object correctly, in case these are not provided by the user. It is a highly recommended 
function to be used throughout due to its flexibility.  

One last important detail which can be noted here: the assignment of `abund` to `sim`. We will now 
discuss the meaning of `simList`, a very special form of list.  

##### 4.3.1. The heart of SpaDES: the `simList`\
\
The simList (named `sim` in the templates) is a list containing the minimum components of a SpaDES 
simulation. It is created by initializing a simulation using `simInit()` and returned when running a 
simulation via a `spades()` call. This list contains all information needed for organizing the events 
(described below), and contains all parameters, inputs and outputs created. Through time and across 
modules, only objects created and stored in this special list are available for the simulations.  

#### 4.4. Events\
\
The events define what will be done by the module (Figure 1). Each module may contain an arbitrary number of 
events, and each event consists of two parts:\
\
(1) *what* to do right now: we generally execute a function returning an object that is appended to `sim`;\
\
(2) *when* to do it again: we generally schedule the same event in the event itself using the function 
`scheduleEvent()`.\
\
The first and only event that is mandatory to have in all modules is called `init`. This event is the 
one responsible for scheduling all other events, and happens for all modules before any other event. 
It can be used to make assertions and checks, for example, or even just schedule the next events. 
In our example the `init` event will be used to confirm the data has the expected columns, and a 
desired format (`data.table`), as well as schedule the next events. Note that for the last event, 
we create an object named `lastYearOfData` and use it for the scheduling of the event. This way, when 
we integrate other modules, we still have this event happening at the "end of this module", as opposed to 
"at the end of all simulations", as these might not coincide, as we will see.\

The next event will then happen in all years, and is going to be named `tableToRasters`. This event 
will convert the table into rasters using the GIS information provided on the table (`lat` and 
`long` columns). In the same event, the raster recently created will be appended to the already existing 
ones, incrementing the raster stack that will hold the abundance rasters of all years.  

Followed by this, we will `plot` both the original data from the first year up to the current year 
(histogram with its distribution) and the newly created raster, using the parameter `.studyAreaName` 
for the plot title. This plotting function will be dependent on the parameter `.plotInitialTime`, 
which will used to schedule the start of plotting events.  

Finally, at the last year of the simulation, we will have an event named `abundanceThroughTime`, which 
will build a simple linear model to identify any trends in abundance though time.  

Our events will (temporarily) have the following format:  

```{r events}
doEvent.speciesAbundance = function(sim, eventTime, eventType) {
  switch(
    eventType,
    init = {
      ### check for more detailed object dependencies:
      ### (use `checkObject` or similar)

      # do stuff for this event
      # Check the data
      if (!is(sim$abund, "data.table"))
        sim$abund <- data.table(sim$abund)
      
      if (!all("abundance" %in% names(abund), 
               "years" %in% names(abund),
               "lat" %in% names(abund),
               "long" %in% names(abund)))
        stop("Please revise the column names in the abundance data")
      
      lastYearOfData <- max(as.numeric(sim$abund[, c("time")]))

      # schedule future event(s)
      sim <- scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim), "speciesAbundance", "tableToRasters")
      sim <- scheduleEvent(sim, P(sim)$.plotInitialTime, "speciesAbundance", "plot")
      sim <- scheduleEvent(sim, lastYearOfData, "speciesAbundance", "abundanceThroughTime")
    },
    tableToRasters = {
      # ! ----- EDIT BELOW ----- ! #
      # do stuff for this event
      

      # schedule future event(s)
      sim <- scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, "speciesAbundance", "tableToRasters")

      # ! ----- STOP EDITING ----- ! #
    },
    plot = {
      # ! ----- EDIT BELOW ----- ! #
      # do stuff for this event

      # schedule future event(s)
      sim <- scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, "speciesAbundance", "plot")

      # ! ----- STOP EDITING ----- ! #
    },
    abundanceThroughTime = {
      # ! ----- EDIT BELOW ----- ! #
      # do stuff for this event

      # e.g., call your custom functions/methods here
      # you can define your own methods below this `doEvent` function

      # schedule future event(s)
      # No need to schedule further events as this one happens at the end of the 
      # module's data

      # ! ----- STOP EDITING ----- ! #
    },
    warning(paste("Undefined event type: \'", current(sim)[1, "eventType", with = FALSE],
                  "\' in module \'", current(sim)[1, "moduleName", with = FALSE], "\'", 
                  sep = ""))
  )
  return(invisible(sim))
}

```

Now that we have filled the `init` event and created and scheduled the other ones, we need to define 
the functions to do the following tasks that are still missing for each event:\
\
**tableToRasters:**\
\
(1) convert the table into rasters (named `abundaRas` as defined in the `createdOutputs()`) using 
the GIS information provided on the table;\
\
(2) append the recently created raster to the full raster stack (named `allAbundaRas`)\
\
**plot:**\
\
(3) plot the original data from the first year up to the current year (histogram with distribution);\
\
(4) plot the newly created raster (`abundaRas`), using the parameter `.studyAreaName` and year for title.\
\
**abundanceThroughTime:**\
\
(5) build a simple linear model using the abundance data (`abund`) to identify any trends in 
abundance though time.\

Each one of these numbered tasks will be converted into a function. At this point, there are two 
options: (1) keep all functions in the module's file as the template suggests (see the functions 
between `doEvent.speciesAbundance` and `.inputObjects`) or (2a) save all functions or (2b) each one 
of them separately in the module's `R/` folder, which gets sourced at the beginning of each module run. 
Although this might be a matter of personal choice, in the case of complex modules, keeping each function 
in a separate file named after the function in the R folder might prove useful to keep the module's 
organization, easier to debug and easier for others to read through the module.\

#### 4.5. Event functions\
\
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">**IMPORTANT: **</span> Avoid using the same names 
for functions and events. It might get confusing to debug and might in some instances fail.\
\
We will now create all functions for the module, except for function (4), which we will use a
pre-existing function from the package `terra`. We will opt, due to the module's simplicity,
to host the functions below in the same script. However, a good common practice for more 
complex modules is to store the functions in the `R/` module folder. This helps keeping the 
main code of the module cleaner and easier to debug and improve. As our `init` event will 
not need any functions, we will start with the next event, `tableToRasters`:\
\
(1) convert the table into rasters (named `abundaRas` as defined in the `createdOutputs()`) using 
the GIS information provided on the table: `convertToRaster(dataSet, currentTime)`\
\
```{r tableToRas1}
convertToRaster <- function(dataSet, currentTime){
  ras <- rast(dataSet[time == currentTime, c("lat", "lon", "abundance")], type="xyz")
  crs(ras) <- "GEOGCRS[\"WGS 84 (CRS84)\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"unknown\"],\n        AREA[\"World\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"OGC\",\"CRS84\"]]"
return(ras)
}
```
\
(2) append the recently created raster to the full raster stack (named `allAbundaRas`):`appendRaster(allAbundanceRasters, newRaster)`\
\
```{r tableToRas2}
appendRaster <- function(allAbundanceRasters, newRaster){
  if (is.null(allAbundanceRasters)){
  # This would happen in the first time we are appending the raster
  allAbundanceRasters <- newRaster
} else {
  # This would happen in the next times
  allAbundanceRasters <- c(allAbundanceRasters, newRaster)
}
return(allAbundanceRasters)
}
```
\
Next, we will move to the event `plot`:\
\
(3) plot the original data from the first year up to the current year (histogram with distribution):`plotAbundance(abundanceData, yearsToPlot)`\
\
```{r plot1}
plotAbundance <- function(abundanceData, yearsToPlot){
  dataplot <- abundanceData[time %in% yearsToPlot,]
  abundData <- Copy(dataplot)
  abundData[, time := as.factor(time)]
  abundData[, averageYear := mean(abundance), by = "time"]
  pa <- ggplot(data = abundData, aes(x = abundance, group=time, color=time, fill = time)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=5) +
    facet_grid(time ~ .) +
    geom_vline(data = unique(abundData[, c("time", "averageYear")]),
               aes(xintercept = averageYear),
               linetype="dashed", color = "black") +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
  return(pa)
}
```
\
(4) plot the newly created raster (`abundaRas`), using the parameter `.studyAreaName` and year for title. This function is not going to be built in the module. It is, instead, a function from the package `terra`. It is here written only to show how we will use it in the     `plot` event: `plot(x, main)`\
\
```{r plot2}
plot(ras, main = paste0(P(sim)$.studyAreaName,": ", time(sim)))
```
\
Lastly, we build the last function for the `abundanceThroughTime` event:\
\
(5) build a simple linear model using the abundance data (`abund`) to identify any trends in 
abundance though time: `modelAbundTime(abundanceData)`\
\
```{r abundanceThroughTime}
modelAbundTime <- function(abundanceData){
  modAbund <- lm(formula = abundance ~ time, data = abundanceData)
  summary(modAbund)
  return(modAbund)
}
```

Now that we have all functions written, we add them to the `speciesAbundance.R` module file. 
The functions part of the file should then look like this, after replacing the example functions 
that come in the template:\
\
```{r allfuns}
convertToRaster <- function(dataSet, currentTime){
  ras <- rast(dataSet[time == currentTime, c("lat", "lon", "abundance")], type="xyz")
  crs(ras) <- "GEOGCRS[\"WGS 84 (CRS84)\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"unknown\"],\n        AREA[\"World\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"OGC\",\"CRS84\"]]"
  return(ras)
}

appendRaster <- function(allAbundanceRasters, newRaster){
  if (is.null(allAbundanceRasters)){
    # This would happen in the first time we are appending the raster
    allAbundanceRasters <- newRaster
  } else {
    # This would happen in the next times
    allAbundanceRasters <- c(allAbundanceRasters, newRaster)
  }
  return(allAbundanceRasters)
}

plotAbundance <- function(abundanceData, yearsToPlot){
  dataplot <- abundanceData[time %in% yearsToPlot,]
  abundData <- Copy(dataplot)
  abundData[, time := as.factor(time)]
  abundData[, averageYear := mean(abundance), by = "time"]
  pa <- ggplot(data = abundData, aes(x = abundance, group=time, color=time, fill = time)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=5) +
    facet_grid(time ~ .) +
    geom_vline(data = unique(abundData[, c("time", "averageYear")]),
               aes(xintercept = averageYear),
               linetype="dashed", color = "black") +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
  return(pa)
}

modelAbundTime <- function(abundanceData){
  modAbund <- lm(formula = abundance ~ time, data = abundanceData)
  summary(modAbund)
  return(modAbund)
}
```

##### 4.5.1. Completing the Events with the needed functions\
\
At last, we will add call the functions in the specific events needed. Here is what the module code 
should look like in the end, after all editing done:\

```{r finalModuleCode}

```

One important note is that all new objects being created (i.e., assigned to `sim` in the form of `sim$object <- function1(args)`) are defined in the `createdOutputs()`. If an object created is not assigned to sim or described in `createdOutputs()` it will not be available at the end of the simulation. This is, for example, the case of the `lastYearOfData` object created in the `init` but not assigned to the `simList`.\

## PART II: creating a SpaDES project to control your module(s)\

### 1. Scripting the project\

SpaDES has additional packages that allow, for example, for the creation of a project. The 
`SpaDES.project` package was designed with a PERFICT approach in mind ([McIntire et al. 2022](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13994)). The advantage of having 
such a project to run your module as opposed to scripts sourcing your module 
through the `simInitAndSpades()` or `simInit()` followed by `spades()` call is that the the whole 
workflow is done in one script, where all needed components need to be present for the 
simulation to run. There is no pre-installing or loading libraries, setting up paths, creating 
objects to be passed to the script, or manipulating data. This eliminates "secret handshakes" and 
allow for your project to be tested, run and improved by others.\
\
Here we provide enough information to set up a project with our example in mind. More detailed guides 
on [using git and GitHub](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/articles/iii-using-git-github.html), [installing dependencies, R and RStudio](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/articles/iv-Installing-R.html), finding [available SpaDES modules](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/articles/v-finding-other-modules.html), and 
setting up a [`SpaDES project`](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/articles/i-getting-started.html) can be found in the [vignettes Session](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/#getting-started) of the Predictive Ecology website.\
\
First, we should install the package.

```{r install-spades-project}
Require::Require("SpaDES.project")
```

The main function in the `SpaDES.project` package is called `setupProject()`. The primary five objectives of this function are:\
\
**1. Preparation for `SpaDES.core::simInit`:** This functions is designed to set the stage for a smooth transition into `SpaDES.core::simInit`, i.e., the initiation of a collection of SpaDES modules. After a `out <- setupProject()` call, the return can be passed directly to `do.call(SpaDES.core::simInitAndSpades, out)`.\
\
**2. Simplicity for Beginners, Versatility for Experts:** The functions are crafted to be approachable for beginners, offering simplicity, while at the same time, providing the power and flexibility needed to address the demands of highly intricate projects, all within the same structural framework.\
\
**3. Handling Package Complexity:** These functions address the complexities associated with R package installation and loading, especially when working with modules created by various users.\
\
**4. Creating a Standardized Project Structure:** They facilitate the establishment of a consistent SpaDES project structure. This uniformity eases the transition from one project to another, regardless of project complexity, promoting a seamless and efficient workflow.\
\
**5. Minimizing .GlobalEnv Assignments:** An important goal is to encourage best practices by reducing the need for assignments to the .GlobalEnv. This practice fosters clean, maintainable code that remains reproducible even as project complexity grows.\
\
This function performs the following tasks:\
- `paths` - Sets standardized paths for the simulation;\
- `modules` - Either downloads them from a cloud repository or uses locally available modules;\
- `packages` - Installs and/or loads (using the `require` argument) packages not already identified in the metadata of the `modules`;\
- `params` - Sets parameter values for any of the `modules`;\
- `options` - Configures basic `R` `options`.\
\
More specifically, this function orchestrates a series of operations in the following order: `setupPaths`, `setupModules`, `setupPackages`, `setupOptions`, `setupSideEffects`, `setupParams`, and `setupGitIgnore`. This sequence accomplishes several tasks, including the creation of folder structures, installation of missing packages listed in either the `packages` or `require` arguments, loading of packages (limited to those specified in the `require` argument), configuration of options, and the download or validation of modules. Additionally, it returns elements that can be directly passed to `simInit` or `simInitAndSpades`, specifically `modules`, `params`, `paths`, `times`, and any named elements passed to ... (`dots`). If desired, this function can also modify the `.Rprofile` file for the project, ensuring that each time the project is opened, it adopts specific `.libPaths()`. This sequence of events allows users to leverage settings (i.e., objects) that are established before others as explained below.\

For user convenience, there are several auxiliary elements, as described in the help file of the function: `?setupProject()`. 
The output from `setupProject()` is a list containing several named elements. These elements are designed to be passed directly to `simInit` to initialize a `simList` and, potentially, a `spades` call.\

Details on why this function is so useful are described in details in its [vignette](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/articles/i-getting-started.html#what-makes-this-function-so-special), but in general, it accepts <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Different Argument Types</span>, such as `url` and local file paths, it performs <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Sequential Argument Processing</span>, which means that prior value can be leveraged by a subsequent one *within the same function call*, and it <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Handles Missing Values</span>, enabling users to source a script passing a required argument, which can be helpful for submitting jobs. More advantages and details on the function can be found in it's documentation by running `?setupProject` in the `R` console.\

As there isn't a specific template, as `setupProject()` is a function, we will provide the templates for our example here. It is good practice to restart your session frequently to improve reproducibility. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of SpaDES, we will establish a couple of different `runs`. These can, in other cases, be seen as different replicates, or different scenarios. Each run has an unique name (`runName`) and a unique set of parameters. We will save each run with different `setipProject()` arguments. The first one will be the most straight forward case using all default parameters and objects.\

Firt, we set our home directory. This is where a folder with the project will be created. This is either created on a disk that has enough space, or scratch paths are provided (i.e., `terra::terraOptions(tempdir = "~/scratch/terra")` before `setupProject()` call, and in `paths = list(scratchPath = "~/scratch/"`) of `setupProject()`).  

```{r firstStep}

```

Once the home directory has been set, we will call the `setupProject()` function. As we don't need to install extra packages than the ones being used in the modules, and as we will, at first, use the default values provided in the module, we will only provide the (1) `paths` to the project and outputs (as we want each call to the project with variations being saved to a different folder), the (2) `modules` that will be used in the project, and the `times` for which the analysis/simulations will happen.\

```{r setupProject1}

# Set the home directory for your project. A directory will be created with its name (projectPath):
setwd("~/GitHub")
runName <- "defaults"

out <- SpaDES.project::setupProject(
  runName = runName,
  paths = list(projectPath = "integratingSpaDESmodules",
               outputPath = file.path("outputs", runName)),
  modules = c(
      "tati-micheletti/getReadySimulationFiles@main",
      "tati-micheletti/caribouPopGrowth_disturbance@main"),
  # options = list(spades.allowInitDuringSimInit = TRUE),
  times = list(start = 2013,
               end = 2022))

snippsim <- do.call(SpaDES.core::simInitAndSpades, out)
```

## THINGS TO PRESENT:
Changing start time of the module (start time)
Change plotting time of the module (change parameter)
Mix matching modules: first abundance alone, then with Temperature, then with LM, at 
last with forecasting
check that lastYearOfData is NOT present in the simList at the end of the simulation
